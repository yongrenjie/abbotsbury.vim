## abbotsbury.vim

Vim plugin which lets you:

 - expand DOIs into full citations, in a filetype-specific manner [(demo)](https://github.com/yongrenjie/abbotsbury.vim#doiexpansiondemo)
 - autocomplete BibTeX entries from `abbot.yaml` files (created by the `abbot` reference manager) [(demo)](https://github.com/yongrenjie/abbotsbury.vim#autocompletiondemo)

### Installation

```vim
Plug 'yongrenjie/abbotsbury.vim'  " vim-plug; similar for other plugin managers
```

Note that this plugin depends on the `abbot` command-line executable.
